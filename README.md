Laboratory of Nuclear and Sub-Nuclear Measurements - Hands on analysis workshop 


## Prerequisites

- A computer
- Not being afraid of using it: physicists are famous for writing horrible code, you cannot but improve our reputation among developers.
- Not being afraid to ask: learning physics takes long enough, there is little time left to learn programming in your studies. It's ok if you have no idea how to do something, but rest assured there is a high chance you can do it. You just have to ask the right questions to the right people.
- Open mind: in general, consider the realm of numerical methods as tools to expand your reach as a physicist.



## Toolbox

- Text editor: take some time to explore few options, and then some more time to learn how to exploit it to your best for coding. Few features can be a game changer for your productivity
- git: We are using git to distribute the code we develop in this workshop. It's the standard for collaborative development and distribution. You may want to consider using this course as an opportunity to start practicing the dark arts of repository management.
- ROOT: "Community standard" for data analysis in particle and nuclear physics. Being a C++ based package it may be a bit less handy than some alternatives but it comes with 30 years of people asking on the internet how to fill and fit an histogram with it.
